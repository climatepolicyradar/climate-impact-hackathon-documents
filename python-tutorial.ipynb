A family has a single main document that is the text of the law or policy, but there may be amendments, official translations, or other documents that we also have in our database for that law/policy. We collect these all as a family, which has potentially many documents under it. \n",

For example, in the following request, we are searching for documents that contain text similar to \"renewable energy\" from the USA, limiting to 10 hits per document, 5 total results per page, and using our semantic search. If you set exact_match to \"True\", you'd get only text that exactly matches \"renewable energy\". You can find out more about the parameters for the API in the api-docs.md file"
