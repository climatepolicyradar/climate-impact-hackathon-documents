# Taxonomy Reference

You'll find that there's an extensive set of taxonomies that we use in our work. You may need these to interact with or analyse our data. For example, when calling the API with a geography filter, you will need to use the same country name as we have in our taxonomy. This page details all the values in our main taxonomies. You can find a JSON formatted version of our taxonomy structure in the `config.json` file.

## Document structure

You'll see references to Families and Documents peppered throughout our resources. We use the name Family to denote a law or policy, for example the UK [Climate Change Act 2008](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/document/climate-change-act-2008_47b4). Each family has a set of Documents associated with it, which are actual documents with text in -- typically PDFs. For example, the Climate Change Act 2008 has [this main document,](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/documents/climate-change-act-2008-4baa?id=climate-change-act-2008_47b4) the actual climate change act 2008 text. There may be other documents in a family, such as translations, amendments, press releases, and so on. These are all documents that are conceptually part of the Climate Change Act family, but will all have different contents. The Main Document is typically the actual text of the law or policy that the Family is a record of.

## Geographies

For geographical regions such as countries or territories, we use the ISO-3166 standard for names and identifying codes. You can find the full list [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes). Geographies are grouped into regions as follows:

| Region                     | Countries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Languages

To represent languages, we use the ISO 639-3 3 letter code standard for language codes and correspohding language names. The full list is [here](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data). Some examples:

| Code | Language Name |
| ---- | ------------- |
| aar  | Afar          |
| abk  | Abkhazian     |
| afr  | Afrikaans     |
| aka  | Akan          |

| ...  | ...           |

## Organisations

The CPR document dataset is currently sourced by two organisations: Climate Change Laws of the World (CCLW), run by LSE and comprising national climate law and policy documents, and the UNFCCC, comprising documents submitted to the UNFCCC such as biennial reports, NDCs, and so on. Documents for each organisation have different sets of metadata associated with them, detailed in the following tables:
