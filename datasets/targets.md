# Targets dataset

You can download our full policy targets dataset [HERE,](https://targets.labs.climatepolicyradar.org/) by clicking the "Download CSV" button. This is a dataset of climate targets made by national governments in their laws, policies and UNFCCC submissions, extracted using a specially trained ML model run on our entire document library.

We define a target as an aim to achieve a specific outcome, that is quantifiable and is given a deadline.

This dataset distinguishes between different types of targets:

- **Reduction** (a.k.a. emissions reduction): a target referring to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, either economy-wide or for a sector.
- **Net zero**: a commitment to balance GHG emissions with removal, effectively reducing the net emissions to zero.
- **Other**: those that do not fit into the Reduction or Net Zero category but satisfy our definition of a target, e.g. renewable energy targets.

All text is in English: the `translated` column describes whether it has been translated from another language using the Google Cloud Translation API. Further to the text and annotations, we also include characteristics of the documents we use to make equity calculations and anonymised assignment of annotations to annotators.
